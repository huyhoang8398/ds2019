If you get lonely, think of me only
Prison isn’t going to keep me from you
Remember Coney Island and how we'd
Wade into the water ’til the waves turned blue

Nobody does have to know that our love’s alive,
Keep it on the low if you want to hide
Got that same address, if you want to write
One Greenwich Avenue, wishing and thinkin’ of you

Living without you is like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I’m around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

If you get lonely, think of this only
Heaven hasn’t forgotten about you
Though you can’t hold me, pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call on your ex-girl, boo
